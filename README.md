# Guessing Game

## Project Description

This is a simple Guessing Game developed in C++ as part of my internship at Prodigy Infotech. The game generates a random number and prompts the player to guess the number. The player receives feedback on whether their guess is too high, too low, or correct.

## Features

- Generates a random number between a specified range.
- Prompts the player to input guesses.
- Provides feedback if the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- Keeps track of the number of attempts.
- Ends the game once the correct number is guessed.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (g++, clang++, MSVC, etc.)
- A development environment or text editor (Visual Studio Code, Code::Blocks, etc.)

### Installing

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/guessing-game.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

    ```bash
    cd guessing-game
    ```

### Running the Game

1. **Compile the Code:**

    ```bash
    g++ guessing_game.cpp -o guessing_game
    ```

2. **Run the Executable:**
